## What I Learned
  - In this project, I used class to class interactions to create new games.

  - I learned more about manipulating the DOM to make changes to display the current player's turn, and increase the win counters.

  - Making and manipulating grids was new to me, but I was able to get it to change to represent the tokens for the player that had selected that box, and stop other players from overwriting it.
